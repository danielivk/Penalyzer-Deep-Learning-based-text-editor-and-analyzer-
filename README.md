Penalyzer is a deep learning-based handwriting text editor, generator, and analyzer. By this tool, the following functionalities are available on handwritten documents:

* Addition/Deletion of handwriting within a given document.

* Writer Identification/Validation using a given document's calligraphic style.

* Handwriting Authentication / Handwriting Deepfake Detection.

A brief about the directories and files in this repo:

* **App** --> The Penalyzer React Native / Flask application.

* **Notebooks** --> .ipynp notebooks that contain the models' training and evaluating procedures.

* **WriterIdentification** --> The Writer Identification subsystem implementation, including all of the models and experiments.

* **Project_Final_Report.pdf** --> The final report of this project, including all relevant information, feels free to read and discuss (mail is attached below).

## Requirements

* Python3.
* Pytorch + torchvision.
* OpenCV.
* Numpy.
* Matplotlib.
* scikit-image.
* Scipy.
* Logging.
* Flask.
* React + React Native + hooks.
* Expo (for running the client-side on phone/emulator).
* PyCharm Community Edition with Anaconda (Recommended).

## Installation

* **Option 1:**
Please install the requirements.txt file in LINK using pip and other non-python requirements presented above.

* **Option 2:**
Please install the dependencies using Anaconda PyCharm (recommended).

## Models and Datasets

* The pretrained models are not given in this repository.

* The training processes were made on a few datasets:

  * The IAM handwritten words dataset.

  * Our handwritten real-fake words dataset.

  * A small set of our authentic words set.

  In order to get the pretrained models / datasets, please send us an email: Daniel.Ivk.software@gmail.com

## Usage

Run the _main_.py file using PyCharm or another environment.
